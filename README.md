🎓 Internship Task 01 – Age Distribution Analysis (Power BI)

This repository contains my first internship task at 'SkillRechnology', where I built a 'Power BI dashboard' to visualize the age distribution of a population sample using continuous data.

 📊 Task Overview
Objective: 
Create a histogram to represent the distribution of ages in a sample population, using Power BI and a preprocessed dataset.

 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- Microsoft Excel

📁 Project Files

Age_Distribution.pbix -> Power BI dashboard file              
Continuous_Population_Dataset.xlsx -> Cleaned dataset with age, height, weight, income, BMI 

 🧪 Features Implemented
- Preprocessed data using Power Query
- Created **age bins** (in 5-year intervals)
- Built a **histogram** using clustered column chart
- Added **slicers** (BMI category, income bracket) for interactivity
- Formatted chart with clear title, labels, and tooltips
